# AdvancedPGM-PerWorldGamemode-
The only fully-featured PerWorldGamemode Plugin you'll ever need. (WIP). From the AdvancedPlugins. _**MOST OF THIS CODE IS FROM [Aliuly's WorldProtect Plugin](https://github.com/Muirfield/pocketmine-plugins/tree/master/WorldProtect) All Credits goes to him, im just recreating this as one Plugin, one command and one function.**_


**Command:**


Command | Parameters
--------|----------
/apgm | (see, set, del)



>_**This plugin is only for PocketMine (MCPE) and third party softwares like [Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys) and/or [ImagicalMine](https://github.com/ImagicalMine/ImagicalMine).**_


> This plugin is Work in Progress (WIP) It means that it is In-Dev, Limited Features, and Some Errors.

> Special thanks to @TheDragonRing for fixing some lines of code, adding permissions, and adding Rules.yml, also is the Co-creator of this Plugin :D.

> Note: This Plugin is ONLY written on PHP so, You can't fit your Plugin on some MCPE Server Softwares like [MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET) Because it is written in C# and [Nukkit](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit) because it is written in Java.


**_Note: This is my very first plugin, feel free to create any issue, suggestion or pull request. Thanks! :D_**
